Capstone answer for the Data Analyst Google Certificate

This is the solution for the Google data case studies. The project implements the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. Below is the background information required to understand the project and data.

# Case Study 1

A startup called Cyclistic rents out bicycles and offers both casual riding alternatives and yearly subscription programs. The future success of Cyclistic, in the opinion of the company's marketing director, depends on increasing the number of annual subscriptions. The marketing team wants to obtain a thorough understanding of how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently in order to accomplish this goal. The team plans to create a customized marketing plan to turn infrequent riders into devoted annual members by learning more about their unique usage patterns and preferences.

The outcome of the project will be a detailed report and data-driven recommendations for the marketing strategy.These recommendations will include answers that explain:
- How annual members and casual riders differ
- Why casual riders would buy a membership
- How digital media could affect their marketing tactics
